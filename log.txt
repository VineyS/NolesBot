As you may have noticed, the Noles Network server is online. But you get an error when joining that says you are not allowed to join with proxies. This is because, we have setup Protection and there is something wrong with it. We are getting into the issue.

Thanks

Abilities:

I am guy, who is partially good at Computer Science, but my aim isnt towards Computer Science. In Computer's, I have gained knowledge on Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL, SQLite. Apart from that, I make the worst defender guy in football teams(its an ability being a defender) Since i know python, i will talking more on it. In python, apart from discord projects, i have developed various other projects like Book Management GUI, Login and registration system GUI, Made a website using both Flask and django, Calculator GUI, etc. I also have experience with most bots in discord even my arch nemesi - MEE6 and Dyno. I guess I have this much to say

💬•general-chat: whyleonhart#8306: whyleonhart: I sense propaganda coming
💬•general-chat: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: Now, the first thing that one should always do before changing a server is first one needs to learn the server.  What I mean is that I simply just can't change the server. First i need learn about it, know its aspects, learn its weakness ,learn its strength, learn its passion. Once when we learn about all these, we can easily identify where exactly the server is going wrong or going correct, or where is it lacking support and how can we fix it or improve it to make it a better place. Now when I am talking servers, it can be any, either it can be discord server or it can be minecraft or it can also applied to real life community groups etc. A server isn't a server, when unity is not there. What I mean is that when we make certain decision to make changes or improvements in the server, it can be beneficial for you but harmful for others, which can cause fights within the server itself resulting intobreaking of the server. However if we think as a unity, nobody can harm server. Now what do i want to convey by saying all these stories. I actually want to convey that making changes in server should be **taken with the help of the people present in the server**. We shouldn't them as a ghost or something. They are also a part of community and they also have right to make opinions. So, If I were to make any changes in server, first I would ask people for suggestions on it , how do they see the server from their view and what should be done to improve the server/community. Now the next thing  what i would do was to make a poll on that idea , whether do other people agree with the change or not. From that i can also see that the people who disagreed have a different point of view for that improvement, maybe they think its either not possible or its actually a terrible idea. So basically i actually consider people suggestion or their point of view rather than my point of view, since even my point of view can also be wrong. Thats what I would do.

staff-commands: _Princee_#1000: _Princee_: .announce **Hey! **
The staff applications are now closed until further notice. You are not able to apply for now. If you open a ticket, or ask to be staff, you will get punished accordingly. 

**Some information before they are open again:**
Please take the application process seriously. Be as detailed as you can and answer only the questions asked. If you have been banned from the server, you are ineligible to apply for a staff rank, even if you have bought a ban-pass and have been approved to rejoin the server. We prefer that all staff be at least 145 years of age, but there can always be an exception. Buying a rank does not give you a better chance of being accepted as a staff member, so please do not linger on this in your application. We will let you know within a week whether your application is being considered or has been denied. If your application is being considered, it does not mean that it has been approved. Be patient with the application process, and always be respectful of staff. 

Keep Safe!

We have some unfortunate news... There was another hacking attempt to our server. Most of it has been resolved, but we have seen major damage to the skyblock server. We are going to keep the skyblock server offline for now to fix the issue. 

Hope you all understand,
_Princee_ Owner of Noles Network.

announcements-of-host: DanBot Hosting #╭❗╏news#0000: DanBot Hosting #╭❗╏news: So im working on a new command it will be `DBH!server manage` this would allow you to manage your server via the bot. from starting, stopping, restarting to viewing its status. This should be done in about a day or two :)

As for `DBH!link` that should also be complete in about a day or two. Once linking is ready to be used again it will work like so: ```
DBH!link 
\/
Bot creates a channel and asks for your email
\/ 
You enter your email
\/
Bot will search for the user. If found it will send a email to the email address you entered with a verification code, If it couldnt find the account it will give you a message saying it cant find the account then close the channel after 2seconds
\/ 
Once you got the verification code you will have 2mins to enter it
\/ 
Once entered the bot will verify the code is correct then link your account. ```

^ that stops people from randomly linking accounts they dont own. With this will come the server delete feature via the bot. This will allow you to delete servers

bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: there is code of the custom status thing if u would like to have it with your own bot
bot-commands🤖: 𝕻𝖊𝖈𝖚𝖑𝖎𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖓𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓#5540: 𝕻𝖊𝖈𝖚𝖑𝖎𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖓𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓: Oooooh
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: u can change it for your needs
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: would u use it <@!726314322565005382> ??
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: i like it and the bot looks cool then
bot-commands🤖: 𝕻𝖊𝖈𝖚𝖑𝖎𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖓𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓#5540: 𝕻𝖊𝖈𝖚𝖑𝖎𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖓𝖆𝖙𝖎𝖔𝖓: I dont think I will, probably for peculiarbot
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: ok
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: well the thing takes one loop to load up
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: so it might not be correct the first loop
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: but the second works
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: Well for loop sequence for a bot for production use
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: There is a limit for change status loop
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: Like 3 mins
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: Idr
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: ok
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: Below that limit violates discord tos
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: well I have my not verified  server bot
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: And results in account termination
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: is that a problem?
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: For Me that’s a problem for my bot
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: it might be on another one if this server hits emoji limit lol
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: For you it’s ok
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: Since
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: ok
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: It’s a single server bot
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: well my one isnt verified
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: and it is 2 server bot
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: so yea
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: I am not talking abt verification here
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: well i mean
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: for 100+ servers
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: u need verification
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: but yea
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: i get the point
bot-commands🤖: DarkShadow04#4707: DarkShadow04: 🙂
bot-commands🤖: PavelDobCZ23#5726: PavelDobCZ23: simply discord wont verify bot breaking tos

Hey! We have reviewed your partnership request, and we are so sorry to say that the application for partnership has been denied. We have seen that there is a lot of un professionality in your Server. There is no player base since online members are 26 from 300+. We advice you that you should work on getting more active members and improving your community, and you can try applying again another time!

Thank you!

Dark Shadow,
Server Head of Noles Network.

staff-chat: RoboTop#2012: RoboTop: Seems like this server doesn't have reaction roles yet! Check out `?help reactrole` for info on how to make them.
staff-chat: _Princee_#1000: _Princee_: ?help reactrole
staff-chat: RoboTop#2012: RoboTop: **React Role:** Set up roles that can be toggled by reacting to a specific message. (requires manage roles permission, max 100 roles)

**List reaction roles:** `?reactrole`
**List reaction roles for message:** `?reactrole [message id]`
**Create reaction role:** `?reactrole [#channel] [message id] [emoji] [role] `
**Delete reaction role:** `?reactrole delete [message id] [role or "all"]`

**Single mode:** When creating a reaction role, type "single" or "s" before the emoji (`?reactrole [#channel] [message id] s [emoji] [role]`)
Single reaction roles will limit members to **one role per message**. Enabling single mode for one reaction role will enable it for all roles on the message.

**Message IDs:** To create reaction roles, you will need to have developer mode enabled so you can copy message IDs.
This can be enabled in user `settings -> appearance -> developer mode`. Once enabled, "Copy ID" should appear when right clicking or long pressing a message

Our host is having Outage this moment, and we are not able to make the costume competition finals for now. We are going to wait. If there is still outage, we will need to postpone the event. 

I hope you understand,

Hey All!
We have made a new update regarding both Discord and Minecraft servers. You can now chat within Discord and Minecraft using the new channels <#755445955234627594> <#772421483406163979> <#772421499088142346> <#772421535255625730> . Not only you can chat and your messages will be shown in Minecraft, you can also see the chat in the Minecraft server as well! You can now see the joins and the leaves of each server!

You will not be able to chat in creative, since we are still working on a reset.
No spam, and no bypassing the rules. 
If we see that people use the system to bypass rules, we are going to take further percussions.

**This a big upcoming maintenance coming:**

This maintenance will be to overall improve the experience of all gamemodes and it will include:

**-**Overall additions and fixes of security including the latest announcement in <#771740819815530536>

**-**Upgrade of overall performance of the lobby server (recomended by members, since it's a bit laggy)

**-**All minigames will be come individual:

**-**Spleef, BedWars , SkyWars will be individual servers to improve overall performance of the server

**-**Release of the new creative!

Even more are coming to this maintenance. Please note that the server is now offline for some host issues, but it will return back. The server will not be offline always for maintenance, since minigames will be just edited. The available gamemode for now is only Skyblock. We are sorry to cause this inconvinience, but we really think that this will help a lot with the server and the community. 


I hope you all understand,
